## Make your own image filter!

As usual, please fork this repo and commit your changes to main.py.

### You may:
* research math packages and add additional requirements in `requirements.txt`
* define helper functions in `main.py` or another file
* implement any filter that is a recognizable version of the original image
* reference the internet and speak with other students, as long as you __cite all sources in code comments!__

### You may NOT:
* use a built-in image filter from Pillow or another library; you must modify the pixels yourself!
* take existing filter code from the internet or another student and only change numbers and variable names
* output an image that bears no apparent resemblance to the input image

### Installing requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install from PyCharm.

### Linting (reformatting) the code
```
black .
```

### Running the code
```
python main.py <path/to/input_image.jpg> <path/to/output_image.jpg>
```
Or run from PyCharm with `path/to/input_image.jpg` and `path/to/output_image.jpg` as run configuration parameters.
